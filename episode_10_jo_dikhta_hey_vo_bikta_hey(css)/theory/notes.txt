Adding styles -:

1st way of wiritngg css - index.css 

2nd - SaaS and SCSC -writing css with some superpower (little more easy) -> not recomended

3rd - Styled components (used with react)

4th -  Material UI - react component library give you component out of box.(prestyled components)

5th - Bootstarp 

6th -chakra UI / ant design 

7th - Tailwind CSS we are using this 
u dont have to leave ur JSX dont have to create seperate file .

-->connfiuring tailwind-CSS
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss
npx tailwindcss init

->postcss -->  it is a tool to transform css inside JS an taiwind uses this 

->npx tailwindcss init --> initializing in to our repository 
creates a file tailwind.config.css 

->we have to create a postcss config also

.postcssrc creat in a root folder and copy

{
  "plugins": {
    "tailwindcss": {}
  }
}

-> change in tailwindcss.config 

content: [
    "./src/**/*.{html,js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],

-> change in index.css file -> romove all css 
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;



--> we are going to give classname -> tailwind gives you seperate class with the help of that we can easily configure css.


--> pros and cons of tailwind CSS-:

->Pros-:
-no need of index.html (dont have to move between files)
-tailwind css is very light-weight
-it will import class only one time (suppose u are using m-4 all over in your app hen only one time it will include that class)


->Cons-:
-when u have to apply lot of css then code beacomes more ugly 
-code beacomes less readable.
