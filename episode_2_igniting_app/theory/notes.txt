-->how we can create our own create react app ?
-->lot of other packges required to make our app fast.
--> how to get that packages.?

-->NMP(does not stand as node package manager)manages packages but it does not stand as node package manager.
->any packages u wnat to use in your project it is on npm.

->nmp init (to configure npm in project).
->after this we will get package.json file
-> what is this packge.json() --> this is configuration what ever we given 
->package.json is configuration for nmp
-> this packege also known as dependency and npm manages that depenedency and in package.json

->bundler --> these are nothing but web-pack,parcel,veet which bundles the app properly and ship to production.
create react app behind the seen uses web-pack and babble .

-> we are using parcel for bundler.its easy to configure.
-> to install parcel -> npm install -D parcel (what is this -D?) -> dev depedency.
->there are two types of dependency 
    1) dev depedency 2)normal depedency 
1) dev depedency used in developement phase 
2) normal depedency are used in production phase.

Q what is package-lock.json() ? 
-->it keeps track of exact track of version of that depedency installed.

Q what is node modules ?
--> this node module contains all the code fetched from npm 
--> it contains the actual data of that depedency's

-->parcel has its own depedency and that depedency has there own depedency --> called as trasitive depedency.
->every depedency has its own package.json 

we dont have to put this files in to our git it is nt necessory . we can have .gitignore file and in that we can put that depedency so that during pushing that file to gie it will get ignored

-->should we keep pacakge.json and package-lock.json on git --> yes 
if i can have  pacakge.json and package-lock.json then i can generate node-modules from that.
just do --> npm install


--> to build app using parcel we have to give command --> npx parcel index.html --> this will create a server for our react app like eg, http://localhost:1234 --> so now our app is ruunning on that url.

-->npx parcel index.html --> sililary as npm we have npx --> npx means executing packages.(for executing pacckage we will use npx parcel) --> means we are executing parcel now.

-->we get react in to our app via CDN we can get our app through npm also
--> CDN is not a prefered way to get our react app ->why?--> fetching from cdn will be costly operation 
-->if i alredy have in node modules then we can get it from there so it is better to get from npm.


--> insatlling react as a packge
command for that is --> npm install react and npm install react-dom

--> now we can remove the CDN links from the index.html 

--> and in our app.js we have to import the React from 'react' //i.e import from react module 
and also import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';


--> when you do this much and try to run the app then you will get one error as -:Browser scripts cannot have imports or exports.
so this error means you have used import in your app.js file which is not a normal JS so to tell that it is a special kind of JS so in your <script> tag you have to add type='module' in it and then after that app will run


what can parser do ? --> 
-dev build
-local server
-HMR - hot module relaod (autmatically refreshes page when you save it).
- it uses file watching algorithm - written in c++ 
- faster builds beacuse of cashing.
- image optimisation 
- minification 
- bundle things 
- compress your file
- consistant hashing
- code spliting 
- differetial bundling - to support on older browser
- digonstics 
- better error suggestions
- gives way to host app on HTTPS 
- tree shaking - will remove unused code for u 
praser is beast.......


--> when you want to build the parsel as a production ready then use command
->npx parcel build index.html
you will encounter error 
for that remove main from you package.json 
(beacuse here we are tellling that starting point is index.html and in main it is app.js so name conflict will be there for that purpose remove the main from pacakge.json())



--> to make you app compatible for different browsers you can configure the browsers list in your package.json file
 "browsersList":[
    "last 2 chrome version",
    "last 2 firefox version"
  ] 
browsersList.dev

"browsersList":[
    "last 2 versions"
  ]
